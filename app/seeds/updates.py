However, we believe that we can do it together. If everyone who attended a 2020 or 2021 freeskewl event donated $1, we would exceed our goal! If this is a project that you believe in, please spread the word! You can ask for a pledge in your name from family and friends for the holidays. This gift will MAKE DANCE HAPPEN and you will receive perks like t-shirts, hybrid classes, VIP performance tickets,  pre-recorded audio classes, and more.',

      description='Hello everyone! After the initial days of the first campaign, I was blown away by all the generous people and their willingness to support this project. The first days of this new campaign has seen nearly quadruple the number of backers as last campaign and I am more amazed and thankful than ever. Needless to say, it was an exciting launch. Another awesome achievement was that Kickstarter recognized the project‚Äôs momentum and gave it the label of a ‚ÄúProject We Love‚Äù. Gaining that honor was in large part because of all those who stuck with the overall project and followed it through to the new campaign. I can‚Äôt thank you all enough for that. Hopefully all this bodes well for continued contributions via exposure on Kickstarter‚Äôs front page and eventual successful funding. There‚Äôs still a ways to go, but we‚Äôre only at the beginning and I am always working on ways to promote the project and get the word out. As always, I‚Äôm open to hearing any suggestions, comments, or concerns, and feel free to ask me any questions you have. Thanks!',

Though things have slowed down a bit in terms of new backers coming on board, I‚Äôm still hopeful the campaign will reach its goal. We are 28% funded and only slightly over a quarter of the campaign over, so considering that, we are still on course to succeed.   In an update I plan to post in a few days, I will be presenting one of the emblems I‚Äôve been recently spending some time thinking about and revising. It‚Äôs emblem number 12 titled Reality. Like most of the emblems, it‚Äôs not a definitive proclamation of what the subject is, but a prompt to start thinking about the topic and maybe challenging preconceived notions. Keep a watch out for that update.',
